#### The Name

The [Lomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_camera) is a camera that began its production life in the 1984. [Lomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_camera) emerged from photography enthusiasts who were enamored with the camera
s tendencies to have unexpected defects blur, light leaks, and color aberrations.\
Lomography involves "taking spontaneous photographs with minimal attention to technical details." If you have ever given your phone/camera to your child the resulting stream of photos with stray fingers, awkward framing, random photos of feet and then strange beautiful magic is embodies the Lomography spirit.
